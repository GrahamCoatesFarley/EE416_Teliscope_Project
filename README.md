# EE416_Teliscope_Project
Design a motorized Pan/Tilt system which can point to a given Azimuth and Elevation angles.
Given the time and GPS coordinates the system should have the ability to calculate the current
location of the celestial objects (can be limited to the planets/moons in the Solar system) and
point the telescope in that direction. Additionally it can/should have the ability to track the orbit
of the object that it is being pointed towards.
(Note: Looking into the possibility of collaborating with the Reynolds Observatory)
